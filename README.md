# Towny Holograms
###### A Spigot Minecraft plugin that gives town mayors/members access to create and manage holograms specifically inside their town.

---

## About the Plugin

This plugin adds the ability for town mayors/workers to create and manage holograms, restricting the holograms to only being inside their town blocks.

The cost of each hologram can be modified in the `config.yml` as well as how many holograms a town can have depending on the size of the town (number of residents) giving server admins full control over how many holograms towns can have.
(Perhaps add an ability to tax depending on how many holograms on towny-day)

Holograms are removed and deleted when a town falls.
Holograms can be cleared in an individual plot on `/plot clear` towny event.
Holograms are automatically cleared 


### Dependencies

This plugin requires:
    - Towny
    - Holographic Displays

## Commands and Permissions

Permissions are made for each command so that server admins can easily pick and choose what town ranks have access to each command.

For example, `Mayor` would have access to all commands. `Assistant` has access to modify the content of an existing hologram. `Builder` has the ability to modify and move an existing hologram.

(Can't get wildcard permissions working at the moment :ANGER:)
